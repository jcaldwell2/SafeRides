# SafeRides


Developed this app for my Software Engineering 1 class in my  undergrad at Radford University.

Written in Java with IntelliJ IDE and Android studio and used a MySQL database.

The goal was to create an application for my client in which drivers would be available to offer rides to people on the weekends at College and
take in GPS coordinates and relay them to Google Maps. The drivers would see a queue of ride requests and riders would request rides and show their locations.

Have not updated since class ended, but might revisit when I have time.

Issues:
Google Maps is interesting to work with since GPS coordinates can be display in the Maps app but at the time there was no way to integrate Maps
in the app itself, so a customs map with be more preferable or there may be ways to have better integration now. 

GPS at the time also was more limited and there was a possible location error of up to 30 feet for the actual location, but that was with technology at the time. The GPS would be accurate but it was I believe an issue with either Google Maps or Android.
